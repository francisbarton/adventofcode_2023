This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL\n\n\n\nSIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007\n\n\n\nPREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.\nThe OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\nDEFINITIONS “Font Software” refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such.

    "text": "Advent of Code is a series of increasingly difficult programming challenges, released daily each year throughout December in the run-up to Christmas.\nThis website is created from the EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template template repository. There’s documentation on how to use and adapt the template in the repo README.\nIt is built with Quarto and works hand-in-hand with the R package aochelpers. The package provides function to manage this website, e.g. to create new posts from a template, to download and read in the puzzle input, and will eventually include functions to help with the challenges themselves. See the package website for more details.\nAs part of the demo, this template comes with an example listing page and Day 1 post for 2022, which you can delete with aochelpers::aoc_delete_year(2022), as well as a listing and introduction to get started for 2023.\nThere are two built-in themes. The light theme is designed to be quite clean, with a Christmas green and red colours. The dark theme is designed to be reminiscent of the Advent of Code website (though not identical, since the design of https://adventofcode.com is part of its registered trademark). You can switch between them using the toggle in the top right corner of the page. Both themes use fonts from iA. The themes can be adapted in the custom-light.scss and custom-dark.scss files."

They’re poor quality, they undermine our business, and they openly violate our copyright. Due to their poor quality, they tarnish our reputation. They’re unethical, illegal, and lame."
