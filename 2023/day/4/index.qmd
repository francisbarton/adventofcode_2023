## Setup

["Scratchcards"](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)

## Part 1


```{julia}

filepath = "2023/day/4/input"

# set this to true to try to get the input data if (eg) it failed before
refresh_input = false 

if !isfile(filepath) | refresh_input
  using HTTP
  function get_aoc_input(year::Int64, day::Int64)
    url_base = "https://adventofcode.com/"
    input_url = "$(url_base)$(year)/day/$(day)/input"
    r = HTTP.get(input_url, ["cookie" => "$(AOC_COOKIE)"])
    if r.status == 200 string(r.body) else "Input read failed" end
  end;

  input = get_aoc_input(2023, 4);

  open(filepath, "w") do file
    write(file, input)
  end
end;

input = split(readlines(filepath), "\n");

# tidy up empty last line, if any
if input[end] == "" 
  deleteat!(input, lastindex(input))
end;

```


_Some initial thinking about how to approach part 1_

## Part 2


Deciding to try using a `struct` (which I only really learned about last night from watching a Julia Academy video).

I guessed that the count problem could be addressed by using a recursive function that amended the list (vector? array?) of cards each time.

Still allergic to `for` loops!

I was really proud of this one, how neat it was in the end.
Especially using `struct`s and the associated constructor function so smoothly, and getting the recursion right after not too many trials and errors.


##### Session info {.appendix}

<details><summary>Toggle</summary>

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(sessioninfo)
# save the session info as an object
pkg_session <- session_info(pkgs = "attached")

# get the quarto version
quarto_version <- system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE)

# inject the quarto info
pkg_session$platform$quarto <- paste(
  system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE), 
  "@", 
  quarto::quarto_path()
  )

# print it out
pkg_session
```
